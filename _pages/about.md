#### Engineering a Smarter, Electrified Future

(Welcome Statement)
Welcome. I am Dewan Mohammad Asad, an Electrical Engineer and Research Assistant dedicated to advancing the frontiers of power electronics and sustainable energy systems. My work sits at the confluence of high-fidelity hardware design and intelligent software algorithms, with a singular goal: to create robust and intelligent solutions for the next generation of power infrastructure and electric mobility.

I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. at the Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET), consistently ranked as the premier engineering institution in the country, where I also completed my undergraduate degree with distinction.

(Featured Research Highlights)

My research is driven by a passion for solving complex, real-world problems. Below are the key initiatives I am leading:

   Intelligent Energy Forecasting for Electric Vehicles
    Under the supervision of Dr. Muhammad Abdullah Arafat, this project involves the development of a sophisticated energy optimization model for EVs. By integrating real-time traffic and elevation data via Google Maps API, alongside proprietary vehicle and battery data from Palki Motors (Bangladesh's first EV manufacturer), we employ both physics-based and machine learning models to accurately predict energy requirements. The ultimate aim is to develop a user-centric application that mitigates range anxiety by providing reliable commute forecasts and intelligent charging station routing.

   Next-Generation Solid-State DC Circuit Breakers
    Also under the guidance of Dr. Muhammad Abdullah Arafat, this research focuses on the design and development of novel solid-state circuit breakers for DC systems. Our design targets a significant improvement in fault detection and interruption speed compared to existing mechanical and solid-state solutions. A key innovation is its robust performance in the presence of parasitic components and its sensitivity to a wide range of fault currents, enhancing safety and reliability in modern power grids.

   Optimizing DC-DC Converters with AI-Driven Control
    Supervised by Dr. A.B.M. Harun-Ur Rashid, Head of the EEE Department at BUET, this work delves into advanced control techniques for SEPIC converters. We are pioneering the application of sophisticated optimization algorithms—including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning—to achieve superior transient performance and stability. This research is fundamental to improving efficiency and responsiveness in power electronic systems.

(Personal Philosophy & Approach)

I firmly believe that the most elegant engineering solutions emerge from a deep understanding of first principles, complemented by the transformative power of artificial intelligence. In the lab and in collaboration, I strive to be a proactive problem-solver—the colleague who brings thoughtful, well-reasoned solutions to the table. I thrive in collaborative environments and am adept at integrating my work within a team to deliver impactful results.

(Forward-Looking Statement)

I am now eager to leverage this multifaceted experience to pursue a Ph.D. where I can contribute to groundbreaking research in Power Electronics, Electric Vehicle Systems, and the application of AI in Smart Grids and Microgrids. I am actively seeking to join a visionary research group where I can both learn from and contribute to tackling the critical energy challenges of our time.
